# CGP-IP

CGP-IP is a Python library based on CGP (Cartesian Genetic Programming: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_genetic_programming) to work on Image Processing.

This libraray is inspired from two papers :

- GENETIC PROGRAMMING THEORY AND PRACTICE X from RICK RIOLO, EKATERINA VLADISLAVLEVA, JASON H. MOORE, MARYLYN D. RITCHIE
- MARS TERRAIN IMAGE CLASSIFICATION USING CARTESIAN GENETIC PROGRAMMING from J. Leitner, S. Harding, A. FÂ¨orster, J. Schmidhuber

This version (as the papers described) is typed. It uses only images in input and output.

A mixed typed version is in preparation and will be release soon.
